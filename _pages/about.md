I hold a personal chair in Computational Mechanics which straddles the Department of Mechanical Engineering, the [**Institute of Data Science and AI**](https://www.exeter.ac.uk/idsai/) at the University of Exeter and [**The Alan Turing Institute**](https://www.turing.ac.uk). At Exeter I lead the [**Datacentric Engineering Group**](https://www.datacentricengineering.co.uk), an interdisciplinary research group of 17 researchers, working at the interface for high performance mathematical models and complex datasets.
 
I currently hold a 5-year Turing AI Fellowship with the Alan Turing Institute. Externally I sit on the editorial board for Proceedings of Royal Society London A and SIAM Journal of Uncertainty Quantification. My researchs interest lie in Bayesian Uncertainty Quantification, Digital Twins, Multiscale Modelling and Scientific Computing, and actively work across various sectors including high value manufacturing, aerospace, air traffic control and construction.
